# Museum of Candy

A (somewhat) beautiful and responsive demo of a landing page. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5.

This is the first actual website I've built after learning HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The JavaScript used is minimal and thus included in the index.html file itself.

## Feedback

If by any chance you are a senior web dev, I'd love to get your feedback and comments on this project. 

I'll keep improving... 

Thanks,\
